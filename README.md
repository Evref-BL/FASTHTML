# FASTHTML  

FASTHTML is a recently created project that integrates with Moose and leverages the Tree-Sitter parser to analyze HTML files in Pharo.  

## Features  
FASTHTML relies on:  
- **[FAST][fast]**, to ensure compatibility with Moose.  
- **[Pharo-Tree-Sitter][pharo-tree-sitter]**, implemented in Pharo via the FFI protocol to efficiently parse HTML files. It is also used to do incremental parsing.

FASTHTML metamodel is defined in a way where nodes align with those generated by Tree-Sitter.

## Installation  

To load FASTHTML in Pharo, execute the following in a Moose image:  

```smalltalk  
Metacello new  
  baseline: 'FASTHTML';  
  repository: 'github://Evref-BL/FASTHTML:main';  
  load.
```  

## Usage

To use it, please ensure that you have installed the corresponding libraries for Tree Sitter on your machine, to ensure parsing succeeds.
Normally, this has been automated for different operating systems.
But for more details, you can have a look at this [blog-post][tree-sitter-blog].

To use it in Pharo, you can check example below:

```smalltalk  
res := FASTHTMLParser new parse: '<p>
    <button disabled>Click Me!</button>
  </p>'. 
```  

## NB

The project is still at the very beginning. But at least now it can parse and generate a model of FASTHTML.
Still need to:
- Reorder classes
- Add new properties
- Check traits
- Add tests

Your contribution is more than welcome.
Happy coding with HTML :)
